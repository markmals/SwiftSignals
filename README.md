# SwiftSignals

This is a collection of Swift reactive state libraries I've attempted to port from JavaScript over the last few years. Included in this repo are:

* `AngularSignals`: Signals implementation based on [`@angular/core`](https://github.com/angular/angular/tree/main/packages/core/primitives/signals)
* `ReactivelySignals`: Signals implementation based on [`reactively`](https://github.com/modderme123/reactively)
* `ObservableSignals`: Signals implementation using [`Observation`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation) under the hood
